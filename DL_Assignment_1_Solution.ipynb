        "The sigmoid activation function is a commonly used activation function in neural networks. It takes an input value and maps it to a value between 0 and 1. Here's how the sigmoid function works:\n",
        "\n",
        "The sigmoid function is defined as:\n",
        "f(x) = 1 / (1 + e^(-x))\n",
        "\n",
        "Given an input x, the sigmoid function applies the exponential function to the negative value of x, adds 1 to the result, and then takes the reciprocal of the sum. This produces an output between 0 and 1, where values closer to 0 indicate a low activation, and values closer to 1 indicate a high activation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Advantages of the sigmoid activation function:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Non-linearity: The sigmoid function introduces non-linearity into the network, allowing it to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs. It enables neural networks to learn and represent non-linear mappings.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Output range: The sigmoid function maps the input to a range of 0 to 1. This property is useful when the output needs to be interpreted as a probability or when the network is performing binary classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "Disadvantages of the sigmoid activation function:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Vanishing gradients: One major drawback of the sigmoid function is that it suffers from the vanishing gradients problem. As the inputs become very large or very small, the derivative of the sigmoid function approaches zero, leading to vanishing gradients during backpropagation. This can cause slower convergence and difficulty in training deep neural networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Output saturation: The sigmoid function saturates at the extremes, meaning that very large or very small inputs result in outputs close to 1 or 0, respectively. When a neuron saturates, the gradients become close to zero, reducing the learning signal passed to the preceding layers. This saturation can lead to slower learning and the network being less sensitive to changes in the weights.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Output bias: The output of the sigmoid function is biased towards the center of its range (around 0.5). This means that the activation of a neuron tends to hover around the middle range, which can slow down learning in certain cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "Due to these disadvantages, the sigmoid activation function is less commonly used in modern neural network architectures. Alternative activation functions such as ReLU and its variants have gained popularity due to their ability to alleviate the vanishing gradient problem and provide better training performance."

This linearity helps in better gradient flow during backpropagation and can speed up training compared to non-linear activation functions like sigmoid.\n",

Vanishing gradients: One of the major disadvantages of the sigmoid function is the vanishing gradients problem, where the gradients become very small as the inputs move away from the center range (around 0.5). ReLU, on the other hand, does not suffer from this issue. When the input to ReLU is positive, the gradient is a constant 1, which helps in faster and more stable gradient flow during backpropagation.\n",

        "4. Sparsity: ReLU activation can introduce sparsity in the network. Since ReLU sets negative inputs to zero, it can lead to a larger number of inactive (zero-valued) neurons in the network. This sparsity can have regularization effects and make the network more efficient by reducing the number of computations.\n",

However, this is typically not a problem in practice as the gradient is defined everywhere except at that specific point. There are also variants of ReLU, such as Leaky ReLU and Parametric ReLU, which address the non-differentiability issue at x=0 and introduce small slopes for negative inputs.\n",
